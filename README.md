# Gophon
Gophon - A graphical gopher client written in FreePascal/Lazarus

## How to compile?
Just download Lazarus (http://www.lazarus-ide.org/) and open the
gophon.lpr project. You should be able to compile this program for
Linux (tested), Windows, MacOS and FreeBSD. Other systems might follow,
but please refer to the list of supported platforms for Lazarus.

## TODO
Oh well...there is a very long todo list... development has just started

* add exception handling ... at the moment the client will just crash :(
* add loaders / handlers for the remaining selector types
* add gopher search query handling
* add a menu for settings
* add bookmarks
* add some credits window
* better history handling
* load/store settings, history
* implement "Download to computer" functionality

## BUGS
Many.... :)
